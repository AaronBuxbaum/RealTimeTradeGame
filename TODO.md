To Do:

Core Features:
1. Polish and increase features for single user
2. Daily/weekly/monthly daemons that cut down the data requirements
3. User system (ie. log in, separate accounts with separate settings)
4. League system (mostly ignored for right now)

Bugs:
1. Yahoo's lookup API doesn't support HTTPS, which causes mixed content errors (makes the lookup widget unusable)
2. Sometimes the options in the list don't have values, which could cause problems if they're added to a portfolio
3. Font doesn't seem to be working properly

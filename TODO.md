To Do:

Core Features:
1. Plug stock ticker into the ticker directive
2. User system
3. League system (mostly ignored for right now)

Bugs:
1. Sometimes the options in the list don't have values, which could cause problems if they're added to a portfolio
2. Font doesn't seem to be working properly

Issues:
1. Data -- how do we avoid having too much at any given time?
  - Perhaps with a nightly/weekly/monthly daemon that reduces down the data

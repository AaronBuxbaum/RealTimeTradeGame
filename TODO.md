To Do:

Core Features:
1. Polish and increase features for single user
2. Daily/weekly/monthly daemons that cut down the data requirements
3. League system (mostly ignored for right now)

Bugs:
1. Font doesn't seem to be working properly
2. Memory issues seem to be occuring, probably related to too much data
3. Some stocks don't work via Google's system, which causes major issues

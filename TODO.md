To Do:

Core Features:
1. Polish and increase features for single user
2. Daily/weekly/monthly daemons that cut down the data requirements
3. User system (ie. log in, separate accounts with separate settings)
4. League system (mostly ignored for right now)

Bugs:
1. Font doesn't seem to be working properly
2. Memory issues seem to be occuring, probably related to too much data
3. When you select a new stock, the autocomplete will not auto-close and show weird stuff
4. Some stocks don't work via Google's system, which causes major issues

To Do:

Core Features:
1. Polish and increase features for single user
2. User system (ie. log in, separate accounts with separate settings)
3. League system (mostly ignored for right now)

Bugs:
1. Sometimes the options in the list don't have values, which could cause problems if they're added to a portfolio
2. Font doesn't seem to be working properly

Issues:
1. Data -- how do we avoid having too much at any given time?
  - Perhaps with a nightly/weekly/monthly daemon that reduces down the data
